### Major Activities 
This work has been completed during this year and is under rereview in International Journal of Computational Fluid Dynamics [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04995)]. The abtract: Real-time accurate solutions of large-scale complex dynamical systems are in critical
need for control, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and decision-making in practical engineering and science applications. This paper contributes in this direction a model-constrained tangent
slope learning (mcTangent) approach. At the heart of mcTangent is the synergy of several desirable strategies: i) a tangent slope learning to take advantage of the neural network speed and
the time-accurate nature of the method of lines; ii) a model-constrained approach to encode the
neural network tangent with the underlying governing equations; iii) sequential learning strategies to
promote long-time stability and accuracy; and iv) data randomization approach to implicitly enforce
the smoothness of the neural network tangent and its likeliness to the truth tangent up second order
derivatives in order to further enhance the stability and accuracy of mcTangent solutions. Both semiheuristic and rigorous arguments are provided to analyze and justify the proposed approach. Several
numerical results for transport equation, viscous Burger’s equation, and Navier-Stokes equation are
presented to study and demonstrate the capability of the proposed mcTangent learning approach.

<figcaption><b>Figure 2:  Wave/transport equation.</b> Trained model-constrained linear neural network weight matrices with model-constrained regularization α = 1e5, noise level δ = 1%. S is number of sequential training steps, R is number of sequential model-constrained steps. The model-constrained weight matrices, after ignoring small elements, have the same structure as the first-order upwind scheme matrix.</figcaption>
