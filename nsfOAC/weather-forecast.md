### Motivation

Computational weather forecasting simulations are costly and inaccurate.

Deep learning alternatives such as Pangu-Weather<sup>1</sup>, GraphCast<sup>2</sup>, provide simulation-level accuracy by ingesting a glut of variables that represent current system state, training next-step prediction.

As this system state is only partially observable, we investigate alternative memory-based approaches via the Mori-Zwanzig formulation<sup>3</sup>.


### Learning the Dynamics of a Partial Observation
Assume weather system is autonomous given enough physical variables:
\\[
\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \mathbf{f(x)} \text{, and } \mathbf{x_0}:=\mathbf{x(t_0)} \text{, with unknown } \mathbf{f}:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n
\\]
Realistically the weather system state, $$\mathbf{x}$$, is only partially known.
\\[
\text{Let }\mathbf{z}\in\mathbb{R}^d\text{ be observable, s.t. }\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{[z\text{ }w]}\text{ and }\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{n-d}\text{ hidden with } n >> d
\\]
 Applying the Mori-Zwanzig formulation<sup>3</sup>, we find additional memory functions (K,F) in the observable dynamics.
 \\[
 \frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{z}(t) = \mathbf{R}(\mathbf{z}(t)) + \int_{0}^t \mathbf{K}(\mathbf{z}(t-s),s)ds + \mathbf{F}(t,\mathbf{x_0})
 \\]
 So flow-map learning (below) as in Pangu-Weather<sup>1</sup> and GraphCast<sup>2</sup> is insufficient.
 \\[
 \frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{z}(t) \approx \mathbf{R}(\mathbf{z}(t))
 \\]

Tests are performed on PredRNN<sup>5</sup> (a convolutional LSTM), LSTM, BERT<sup>6</sup> (en/decoder-only temporal transformer), and ReZeroTF (reZero<sup>7</sup> architecture, en/decoder-only transformer).

### PDE Prediction
<div class="poster-scols" markdown="1">

- Rayleigh-Bénard PDE problem for preliminary testing

\\[
     \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{t}} = 0.05 * [\nabla\cdot\nabla u - \nabla \cdot (u\mathbf{v}) + u(1-u^2)]\text{, where } \mathbf{v}=0.1 <-y,x>
\\]

- Note no hidden variables (single-variable system)
- PredRNN and ReZero transformer performed best
- PredRNN is less dependent on memory length.
- 30 frames seems to be a limit for a 40-frame set.

| MSE    | 3 Frames | 10 Frames | 20 Frames |
| -------- | ------- | --------- | --------- |
| PredRNN  | 0.022  | 0.016    | 0.011   |
| ReZeroTF | 0.259  | 0.053    | 0.024   |

#### Direct Prediction (PDE)

- ReZero uses FCN layers, so pointwise behavior results in noisy output.
- PredRNN applies CNN filters to produce a smooth result.

So variants replacing the transformer FCN layers with CNN or NAT (neighborhood attention) layers improve with sparser attention and smoother output respectively.

| - | PredRNN | ReZero | ReZeroCNN | ReZeroNAT |
| -------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| MSE | 0.01  | 0.07    | 0.04   | 0.036   |

#### Reduced Order : POD & DMD

| MSE | PredRNN | LSTM | ReZeroCNN | ReZeroNAT |
| -------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| POD | 0.7400  | 0.4902    | 0.1214   | 0.0985   |
| DMD | 0.1882  | 0.1028    |  > 1   |  > 1   |

- The (best) LSTM and reZeroTF shown have relative MSE 17% and 3.5% respectively. Note the LSTM also learns that memory is redundant!
- As expected, LSTM performs best with a linear preprocessor, while the transformer performs best with independent axes (from POD).
- The CNN and NAT variations do not improve performance (5 and 5.3% relative MSE).
- *ReZeroTF and LSTM with POD have differing scales, and the saliency maps shown are for a different, but consistent prediction.
